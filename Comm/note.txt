Direct forwarding with node, if the node is different, it is forwarded through the routing table.
Each machine can connect multiple external nodes
The node finds the virtualIp direct route through the table route.

COMM can find the forwarded Ip through nodeId

After receiving the msg sent by the network, COMM determines whether the nodeId is the same. If it is different, it needs to be forwarded.
If a packet that cannot be forwarded by the local node is received, it is discarded.
But now it seems that it can't be done? ! So if there is a Loop, it will definitely be an infinite loop. Should I add a TTL? Still forget it
